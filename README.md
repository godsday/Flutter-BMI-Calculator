## Our Goals

The objective of this tutorial is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. If you have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, we can create them using Flutter.The Getx Tool is used to maintain the state.

## What is it ?

Weâ€™re going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by my self. It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
